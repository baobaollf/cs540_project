## Introduction
- - -
The following code implements a high fidelity prototype of our
framework idea  
**Easy connect.** The prototype is divided in 3 separates 
programs;
1. server 
2. server2 
3. client

The code simulated the connection in a CDN cluster between two 
authentication servers (AS) and a client. To simulate real world 
conditions both servers need to be running before the client tries to
connect.

The prototype simulates the following:
- A client connection to an authentication server.
- The sharing of clients security object between the servers after
  client login.
- The servers serving content to the client.
- Client switching content servers.
- Client log out and removal of clients security object in 
  authentication servers.
