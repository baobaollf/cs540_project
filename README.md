# Authentication server framework Prototype Readme
## For CS540 Spring 2021

## Introduction
The following code implements a high fidelity prototype of our
framework idea  
`Easy connect` The prototype is divided in 3 separates 
programs. Server, Server2 and Client.

The code simulated the connection in a CDN cluster between two 
authentication servers and a client. To simulate real world 
conditions both server would be running before the client tries to
connect.
